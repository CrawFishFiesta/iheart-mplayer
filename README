$ ./iheart-url -h
usage: iheart-url [-h] [-v] [-i] [-s TERMS] [-l TERMS] [station_id]

Print the audio stream URL for an iheartradio station

positional arguments:
  station_id            The (five-digit?) ID number of the station

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Display extra information
  -i, --info            Instead of printing the stream URL for the station,
                        output some information about it
  -s TERMS, --search TERMS
                        List station search results for TERMS
  -l TERMS, --lucky TERMS
                        "I'm feeling lucky" search for TERMS (print URL for
                        the first result)

The primary intended usage of iheart-url is in UNIX shell command subsitution,
like so:

$ mplayer -novideo $(./iheart-url [station_id])

Two trivial shell scripts that do exactly this, iheart-mplayer and iheart-vlc,
are included. They both pass all of their own positional arguments to 
iheart-url, and therefore their commandline usage is essentially identical. So
to actually play a radio station, you might do:

$ ./iheart-mplayer [station_id]

Station IDs can be obtained with the search function (-s), or from the URL
you'll get if you find a station on the website; for instance the ID for this
URL is 5361:

http://www.iheart.com/live/News-Talk-760-5361/

Further technical documentation can be found in the source itself, and in
iheart-api.
