$ ./iheart-mplayer.py -h
usage: iheart-mplayer.py [-h] [-v] stream_id

Play an iheartradio station in MPlayer

positional arguments:
  stream_id      The (five-digit?) ID number of the station

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  Display extra information

Station IDs are unfortunately fairly clunky to obtain. You can get it from the
URL you'll get if you find a station on the website, for instance the ID for
this URL is 5361:
